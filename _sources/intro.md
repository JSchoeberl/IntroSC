# Introduction to Scientific Computing

Joachim Sch√∂berl

TU Wien, Institute of Analysis and Scientific Computing


Many scientific challenges require non-trivial software solutions, which have to be tackeled by researchers with diverse skills. 

In this class we learn the development of scientific software in a *learning by doing* approach.

We have chosen two typical application areas: Basic Linear Algebra, i.e. computing with vectors and matrices, and numerical solution of partial differential equations. 

This lecture is designed for students in applied mathematics in an early stage.

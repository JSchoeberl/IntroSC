# Python bindings

C++ and Python are are strong combination: With C++ we can program for maximal performance, with Python we can work with objects in a very convenient way. Both share a similar object oriented paradigm.

Python bindings allow to use C++ functions and classes from Python.

A very popular library for wrapping C++ objects to Python is
[pybind11](https://pybind11.readthedocs.io/en/stable/).


Now you have to install (Python)[https://www.python.org]. Choose a recent version (at least Python 3.8 should be ok). Using conda is also fine, you have to replace `pip install` by `conda-install` in the following.


Install pybind11 as a Python package:

    pip install pybind11


Now clone the pybind-branch from the [ASC-git/pybind](...)

# Solving ordinary differential equations

We are developing a library for solving nonlinear ordinary differential equations. First we build an abstraction of nonlinear functions, and implement solvers for nonlinear equations. On this basis we can simply define time-stepping algorithms. We apply it to multi-body systems. OpenGL visualiztion is provided based on the python interface to threejs.

- Solving non-linear equations
- Explicit and implicit time-stepping methods
- Connecting masses with springs
- Introducing constraints

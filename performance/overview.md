# Overview

We learn how to unleash the full power of our computers. This includes

- **Vectorization**: single instructions can operate on multiple data, for example perform four double precision multiplications simulteneously
- **Pipelining**: several vector-instructions can be started per clock
  cycle, but it takes several cycles to complete. Start new work befor
  results of old work are ready
- **Caches**: getting data from main memory is expensive. Caches keep recently used data in fast but small cache memory. 
- **Parallelization**: most CPUs have several physical cores. Write multi-threaded code to split work to multiple cores

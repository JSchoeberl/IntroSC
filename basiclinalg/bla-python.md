# Python bindings

C++ and Python are are strong combination: With C++ we can program for maximal performance, with Python we can work with objects in a very convenient way. Both share a similar object oriented paradigm.



Python bindings allow to use C++ functions and classes from Python.

A popular library for wrapping C++ objects to Python is
[pybind11](https://pybind11.readthedocs.io/en/stable/).


Now you have to install [Python]([https://www.python.org). Choose a recent version (at least Python 3.8 should be ok). Using conda is also fine, you have to replace `pip install` by `conda-install` in the following.


Install pybind11 as a Python package:

    pip install pybind11


Now clone the pybind-branch from the ASC-git:

    git clone --branch pybind https://github.com/TUWien-ASC/ASC-bla.git

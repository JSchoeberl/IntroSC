## Creating documentation

We use [ReadTheDocs](https://docs.readthedocs.io) based on [Sphinx](https://www.sphinx-doc.org) for creating documentation.


Quick steps to setup the documentation:

    mkdir docs
    cd docs
    sphinx-quickstart
    make


in conf.py you can select the theme, for example:

   html_theme = 'sphinx_rtd_theme'



Register to readthedocs with your github account.
On your dash-board you can see your (public!) github projects. Import the project.
